Operators

Python has different types of operators for different operations. To create a calculator we require arithmatic operators.

            Operator        Operator Name                 Example
                +               Addition                  15+7
                -           Substraction                  15-7
                *           Multiplication                5*7
                /           Division                      15/7
                **          Exponential                   15**7
                %           Modulus                       15%7
                //          floor division                15//7

print(5**3)

# exercise 1 : Create a Calculator
'''
Create a calculator capable of performing addition, subtraction , multiplication and division operations on two numbers. Your program should format the output in a readable manner!
'''

# Solve:
print("Addition of 5 and 6 is ", 5+6)
print("Substraction of 5 and 6 is ", 5-6)
print("Multiplication of 5 and 6 is ", 5*6)
print("Division of 5 and 6 is ", 5/6)

#solve 2:

a = 50
b = 3
print("The value of", a, "+", 3, "is: ", a+b)
print("The value of", a, "+", 3, "is: ", a-b)
print("The value of", a, "+", 3, "is: ", a*b)
print("The value of", a, "+", 3, "is: ", a/b)
